# Bird Species Classification
This project classifies ten different bird species using machine learning models. It leverages Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Transfer Learning approaches (EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet-50). The focus is on rigorous data preprocessing and augmentation practices to enhance classification accuracy.

## Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
• **Balanced Data:** Ensured uniform representation of the top ten bird species to avoid any potential bias towards or against any particular species.

• **Grayscale Conversion:** Created additional augmented data by converting the images in the dataset to grayscale.

• **Image Resizing:** Used 64×64 for traditional ML and 224×224 for CNNs/Transfer Learning.

• **Augmentation:** Applied random flips, rotations, crops, brightness, and contrast shifts.

Algorithms
• Multinomial Logistic Regression
• Random Forest
• Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
• Transfer Learning (EfficientNet-B0 & ResNet-50)

Future Work
• Increase dataset size to include more bird species.
• Investigate new machine learning architectures to improve precision.
• Develop real-time classification capabilities for field applications.
